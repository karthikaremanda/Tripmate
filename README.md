TRIPMATE - Urban Mobility Analytics Platform
From Guesswork to Science: Revolutionizing Urban Transport Planning with Real-Time Data.

The Problem: Planning Cities with an Outdated Map
Modern cities are dynamic, complex systems. Yet, urban transport planners are often forced to make multi-crore decisions using data collection methods from the last century: slow, expensive, and small-scale manual surveys. This leads to massive inefficiencies:

🚌 Inefficient Public Transport: Bus routes that run empty while others are dangerously overcrowded.

🚗 Chronic Traffic Congestion: Reactive traffic management that only addresses yesterday's problems.

🏗️ Flawed Infrastructure Investment: New flyovers and metro lines planned with old, inaccurate data.

This guesswork costs our cities crores in wasted resources, costs our citizens hours lost in traffic, and directly contributes to pollution.

The Solution: A Live Pulse of the City
TRIPMATE is a web-based prototype for a data platform that replaces the clipboard with the smartphone. It creates a seamless, real-time data pipeline from the citizen's daily journey directly to the urban planner's analytical dashboard.

By capturing live, anonymized travel data with user consent, TRIPMATE provides the actionable intelligence needed to build smarter, more efficient, and sustainable cities.

✨ Key Features of the MVP
👤 Role-Based Access: Separate, secure dashboards for Travelers (data creators) and Analysts (data consumers).

📍 Real-Time GPS Tracking: Travelers can record their trips live using their device's GPS.

📝 Rich Data Context: Users can easily add crucial metadata to each trip, including purpose, mode of transport, number of co-travelers, and qualitative notes (e.g., "heavy traffic").

🗺️ Instant Data Visualization: The Analyst dashboard updates in real-time as new trips are saved, visualizing the route on an interactive map.

📍 Automatic Geocoding: Automatically converts raw start/end coordinates into human-readable addresses.

☁️ Cloud-Native & Scalable: Built on a serverless architecture that can scale from one user to millions.

🛠️ Technology Stack
This MVP was built using a modern, scalable, and real-time tech stack:

Frontend: ReactJS with Tailwind CSS

Mapping: Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap

Backend & Database: Google Firebase (Firestore for real-time DB, Firebase Auth for authentication)

Hosting: Deployed as a static web application.

🚀 How to Run This Prototype Locally
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/karthikaremanda/Tripmate.git](https://github.com/karthikaremanda/Tripmate.git)

Navigate to the Folder:

cd TripMate-app

Firebase Setup:

Open the index.html file in a text editor.

Find the firebaseConfig object (around line 55).

Replace the placeholder keys ("YOUR_API_KEY", etc.) with your own configuration keys from your Firebase project.

Ensure you have Email/Password authentication enabled in your Firebase console.

Create a Firestore Database in your Firebase project (start in test mode).

Run the Application:

Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. A local server is not required.

🔮 Future Vision & Roadmap
This MVP is the foundation. The full vision for TRIPMATE includes:

📱 Native Mobile Apps (Flutter): For robust background tracking and a superior user experience.

🧠 On-Device AI: Using TensorFlow Lite to automatically detect the mode of transport (car, bus, walk) from sensor data.

🌐 Full Offline Support: A true "offline-first" architecture that saves trips locally and syncs automatically when a connection is available.

📊 Advanced Analytics Dashboard: A dedicated dashboard for planners with heatmaps, flow diagrams, and predictive models.
